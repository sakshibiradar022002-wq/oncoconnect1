# OncoConnect Server — Secure Neuro-Oncology EMR Backend

Real backend for the OncoConnect platform. Node + Express + SQLite, built security-first:
**PHI encrypted at rest, revocable server-side sessions, and role-based access control.**

This turns the single-file HTML prototype into real software — cross-device sync, real
authentication, and encrypted patient data all come from moving off localStorage to this server.

## What makes this "real" (vs the localStorage prototype)

| Concern | Prototype (localStorage) | This backend |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-device | Same browser only | Any device — data lives on the server |
| PHI at rest | Plaintext JSON | AES-256-GCM encrypted, per-record IV + auth tag |
| Passwords | Hashed in-browser | PBKDF2-SHA512, 210k iterations, per-user salt, timing-safe |
| Sessions | None | httpOnly cookie + server-side revocable session table |
| Access control | None | RBAC — doctors see only their patients; labs see only their tasks |
| Storage limit | ~5 MB | Disk-bound (gigabytes) |
| Audit | What changed | Who changed it, when, from what IP — append-only, encrypted |

Every one of these is covered by an automated end-to-end test (31 assertions, all passing).

## Security architecture

- **src/crypto.js** — all cryptographic primitives in one auditable place.
  - Passwords: PBKDF2-SHA512, 210,000 iterations, 16-byte random salt, timingSafeEqual.
  - PHI: AES-256-GCM. Each record gets a fresh 12-byte IV; the GCM auth tag detects tampering.
    Blob format: v1.<iv_b64>.<tag_b64>.<ciphertext_b64>.
  - Master PHI key comes only from PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY (env). Never hard-coded.
- **src/middleware/auth.js** — JWT in an httpOnly, sameSite=lax, secure (prod) cookie,
  backed by a server-side session row so logout/revocation is real, not just token expiry.
- **RBAC** via requireRole('doctor') etc. Ownership enforced per query (WHERE doctor_id = ?),
  so one doctor can never read another's patients.
- **Rate limiting** — 30 auth attempts / 15 min, 300 API calls / min per IP.
- **Helmet** sets a strict Content-Security-Policy and hardening headers.
- **Zod** validates every request body before it touches the database.

### What's plaintext (on purpose)
Only non-PHI, index-needed columns: internal ids, MRNs and emails (login identifiers),
timestamps, roles, foreign keys, due dates and priorities (for sorting). Every clinical
field — names, diagnoses, molecular results, lab values, symptom logs, messages — is encrypted.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# generate the two secrets:
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET='+require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY='+require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
# paste both into .env, then:
npm run init-db
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — doctor app at /, patient/lab app at /patient.html.

Node 20+ required. Uses better-sqlite3 if it compiles, otherwise falls back to the
built-in node:sqlite (Node 22+) automatically — zero native build step needed.

## Deploy to a cloud host

### Vercel + Turso (free, no card required)
The app data lives in Turso (free cloud SQLite), so the host needs no disk:
1. On turso.tech: sign up (GitHub login), create a database, copy its
   libsql:// URL and create an auth token.
2. On vercel.com: sign up (GitHub login, Hobby plan), Add New -> Project,
   import this repo. vercel.json routes everything through api/index.js.
3. Set three environment variables before deploying:
   - PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY (64 hex chars — generate with the command above)
   - TURSO_DATABASE_URL (the libsql:// URL)
   - TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
   - JWT_SECRET (another 64-hex-char random string)
4. Deploy. The PWAs install straight from the https://<project>.vercel.app URL.

Note: serverless = each instance rate-limits independently, and there is no
local file state — both fine here since all state is in Turso.

### Render (blueprint included)
1. Push this folder to a Git repo.
2. On Render: New -> Blueprint, point it at the repo. render.yaml runs the
   app on the free plan with data in Turso (same env vars as above;
   JWT_SECRET is auto-generated).

### Fly.io
```bash
fly launch
fly volumes create chemocure_data --size 1
fly secrets set JWT_SECRET=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")
fly secrets set PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")
fly deploy
```
Mount the volume at /data and set DB_PATH=/data/chemocure.db.

### Railway
New project -> Deploy from repo. Add the same env vars in Variables, add a volume
mounted where DB_PATH points.

CRITICAL: back up PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY somewhere safe and separate from the database.
If you lose it, every encrypted record becomes permanently unreadable.

## Two installable apps (PWA)

The platform ships as **two separate installable apps**, both served by this one server:

| App | URL | Installs as | Theme |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OncoConnect Pro** (Doctor) | `/` | Desktop/laptop software | Blue |
| **OncoConnect** (Patient) | `/patient.html` | Phone app (home screen) | Green |

Each has its own web manifest, service worker (scoped so they never collide), and app icon.
Once deployed over HTTPS, the browser offers an **Install** button:

- **Doctor (desktop):** Chrome/Edge show an install icon in the address bar, or use the
  in-app "Install OncoConnect Pro" banner. It then opens in its own window like native software.
- **Patient (phone):** Android Chrome shows an "Install" banner; iOS Safari shows a hint to
  tap **Share → Add to Home Screen**. It launches full-screen with no browser chrome.

**Offline behavior:** the app shell (HTML/JS/icons) is cached so each app opens instantly and
works offline for the last-loaded view. **PHI is never cached** — every `/api/*` request goes
straight to the network and requires a valid session, so patient data is always fresh and
server-authorized.

> PWAs require HTTPS. All the recommended hosts (Render/Fly/Railway) provide it automatically.
> On `localhost` it also works for testing.

## API surface

All under /api. Session cookie is sent automatically (credentials: 'include').

Auth: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login (doctor accounts)
Sync: GET/PUT /sync (doctor keyspace), POST /sync/patient-login,
  GET/PUT /sync/patient (MRN-scoped), POST /sync/lab-login,
  GET/PUT /sync/lab (task/submission-scoped)

## How the HTML apps stay connected (cross-device sync)

The UIs keep their working data in localStorage for instant, offline-capable
reads — and public/sync-client.js mirrors every change to the server:

- Signing in authenticates against the backend and pulls the account's data
  onto the device (per-key last-write-wins), so a doctor can log in anywhere
  and see their patients; a patient needs only their MRN + password on any phone.
- Every localStorage write is pushed back to the server (debounced), stored
  AES-256-GCM encrypted in the kv_store table.
- Accounts created before the backend existed are enrolled automatically on
  their next login, and local-only data is uploaded on first server sign-in.
- If the server is unreachable, both apps keep working local-only and the
  sync retries later.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                                        # local SQLite backend
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=file:/tmp/t.db npm test      # libsql backend
```

test/e2e.test.js boots the real server on a random port with a throwaway
database and exercises every route group over HTTP: registration, login,
duplicate-email and wrong-password rejection, RBAC, patient CRUD, messages,
appointments, symptom logs, the full lab workflow (assign -> tech login ->
submit -> doctor reads results), kv-sync push/pull with patient scope
enforcement and credential stripping, session revocation on logout, and —
most importantly — confirming patient names and diagnoses are never present
in plaintext in the raw database file. No test framework needed (node:test).

## Not yet included (honest scope)

This is the security-first core. Still worth adding for full production:
- PHI key-rotation script
- HTTPS is assumed to be terminated by the host (Render/Fly/Railway all do this)
- Formal HIPAA/GDPR compliance review before real patient use

## Two-factor authentication (doctors)

Dependency-free TOTP (RFC 6238), compatible with Google Authenticator/Authy:

    POST /api/auth/totp/setup    → { secret, otpauthUrl }   (add to authenticator)
    POST /api/auth/totp/enable   { code }                    (prove it works)
    POST /api/auth/login         { email, password, totpCode }  (from then on)
    POST /api/auth/totp/disable  { code }

The doctor app prompts for the code automatically at sign-in once enabled.

## Operations

    npm run make-admin -- doctor@example.com   # promote an account to admin
    npm run backup                             # WAL-safe snapshot to ./backups (keeps last 30; local SQLite only)
    npm run rotate-key                         # re-encrypt all PHI under a new master key:
    # PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<current> NEW_PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<new> npm run rotate-key

Backups contain ciphertext only. Store PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY separately from
backups — one without the other is useless to an attacker.

## Clinical extras

- **Doctor: protocol templates** — Stupp, TMZ maintenance, PCV, bevacizumab,
  and a supportive-care bundle applied to the med list in one click from the
  patient record header (dose review still required — mg/m² needs BSA).
- **Patient: medication reminders** — daily times with browser notifications
  while the app is open (synced across the patient's devices).
- **Patient: education library** — diagnosis, TMZ, radiotherapy, red-flag
  symptoms, nutrition, fatigue, and caregiver guidance.

## Email (Gmail)

The server sends registration verification codes and appointment reminders
itself once two env vars are set:

```
GMAIL_USER=you@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
```

The app password comes from Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification →
App passwords (normal Gmail passwords will not work). Any other SMTP provider
works via `SMTP_HOST/SMTP_PORT/SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASS/SMTP_FROM`.

Check it from the app: Data & Backup → Email Setup shows a live status line
(`/api/email/status?verify=1` runs a real SMTP handshake). With no email
configured the app falls back to EmailJS (browser-side, keys in the same
panel) and finally to dev mode, which shows the verification code on screen.
OTP codes are generated and verified server-side, stored hashed, single-use,
10-minute expiry, rate-limited.


## Deploying

**Render (recommended, one-click-ish):**
[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/sakshibiradar022002-wq/OncoConnect)

Click the button (or Render → New → Blueprint → this repo → Apply). Render
auto-generates both app secrets; you only paste a free Turso database URL +
token. See **render.yaml** (includes a no-Turso persistent-disk alternative).

**Vercel:** serverless, so SQLite files do not persist — use a free Turso
database and set the environment variables. Full step-by-step: **DEPLOY_VERCEL.md**.

Both hosts need the same secrets. `PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` accepts any strong
secret (a 64-hex value is used as-is; anything else is SHA-256-derived), so
managed hosts can generate it for you.
