# VELTRUVIA HIPAA Compliance Guide

**Last Updated:** July 30, 2026  
**Status:** Compliance Framework Documented  
**Certification Required Before Production:** Yes

---

## 1. System Security Plan (SSP) Overview

VELTRUVIA implements comprehensive HIPAA Security Rule compliance through:

### Administrative Safeguards ✅
- **Security Management Process:** Risk-based access controls
- **Workforce Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Roles: doctor, patient, lab, admin
  - Each role gets only necessary permissions
- **Information Access Management:** Patient data isolation
  - Patients see only their own records
  - Doctors see only assigned patients
  - Labs see only assigned tasks
- **Security Awareness Training:** Documented in team handbook
- **Security Incident Procedures:** Breach notification plan (see below)

### Physical Safeguards ✅
- **Facility Access:** Render/Turso managed data centers
  - SOC 2 Type II certified
  - DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
  - TLS 1.3+ encryption in transit
- **Workstation Security:** Client-side only (browsers)
  - No desktop software required
  - No removable media
  - Can work on any device

### Technical Safeguards ✅
- **Encryption:**
  - At rest: AES-256-GCM (military-grade)
  - In transit: TLS 1.3+ with HSTS
  - Key management: Automated via environment variables
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Doctor 2FA: TOTP + password (210k PBKDF2v2)
  - Patient: MRN + OTP (SMS/email/screen)
  - Session management: Revocable JWT tokens
  - No credentials in transit between portals
- **Audit Controls:** Comprehensive logging
  - Every write logged with actor ID, timestamp, IP
  - Access audit (who viewed what patient, when)
  - Cannot be modified/deleted (append-only)
- **Integrity Controls:** Database constraints
  - Foreign keys enforce data consistency
  - Primary keys prevent duplicates
  - Transaction rollback on errors

## 2. Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Must Mitigate Before Production)

**Risk 1: Unauthorized Data Access**
- Likelihood: Medium (phishing, credential theft)
- Impact: Severe (patient PHI exposed)
- Mitigation:
  - ✅ Implement 2FA for all doctor accounts
  - ✅ Rate-limit login attempts
  - ✅ Session revocation capability
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Add email notifications of new logins
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Implement IP whitelisting (future)

**Risk 2: Data Breach via Third-Party**
- Likelihood: Low (vendor is SOC 2 Type II)
- Impact: Severe (massive patient data exposure)
- Mitigation:
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Obtain Business Associate Agreements
  - ✅ All vendor communication encrypted (HTTPS)
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Incident response plan for vendor breach

**Risk 3: Database Corruption**
- Likelihood: Very Low (Turso redundancy)
- Impact: Severe (data loss)
- Mitigation:
  - ✅ Automated daily backups (Turso)
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Test restore quarterly
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Document RTO/RPO in runbooks

**Risk 4: Ransomware**
- Likelihood: Low (managed cloud)
- Impact: Severe (service down, data encrypted)
- Mitigation:
  - ✅ No local file storage on servers
  - ✅ Database immutable from server perspective
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Vendor ransomware insurance

---

### Medium Risks

**Risk 5: Unauthorized Modification of Patient Data**
- Likelihood: Low (strong RBAC)
- Impact: Severe (wrong treatment dosing)
- Mitigation:
  - ✅ Audit log tracks all modifications
  - ✅ Role-based access control
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Add confirmation dialogs for dose changes

**Risk 6: Eavesdropping in Transit**
- Likelihood: Very Low (TLS 1.3)
- Impact: Severe (patient data captured)
- Mitigation:
  - ✅ TLS 1.3+ required
  - ✅ HSTS headers (force HTTPS)
  - ✅ Certificate pinning ready (not implemented)

**Risk 7: Availability Loss**
- Likelihood: Low (99.5% uptime SLA typical)
- Impact: High (patients can't access)
- Mitigation:
  - ✅ Auto-scaling on Render
  - ✅ Multi-region CDN (Vercel)
  - ⚠️ **Action:** Add monitoring/alerting

## Email Templates for BAA Requests

### To Email: [vendor]@company.com

Subject: HIPAA Business Associate Agreement Request

```
Dear [Vendor] Team,

We are planning to deploy VELTRUVIA, a healthcare application that will handle Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA.

To comply with HIPAA Security Rule, we require a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with [Vendor].

Questions:
1. Do you have a standard BAA template we can review?
2. Do you support covered entity + business associate relationships?
3. What data subprocessors do you use? (for SCCs)
4. What is your SOC 2 Type II audit status?
5. Do you offer encryption at rest and in transit?

Can you send documentation to [contact@example.com]?

Timeline: We aim to go live in [DATE], so we'd need BAA signature by [DATE].

Thank you,
[Your Name]
[Your Hospital/Practice Name]
```

**STATUS:** Compliance framework documented. 
**NEXT PHASE:** Obtain vendor BAAs and conduct penetration test.
